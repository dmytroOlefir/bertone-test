        <div class="about-story-right">
          <p>Founded in 1912 in Turin by Giovanni Bertone, the Bertone body shop was an important player in the automotive industry for a little over a century, before disappearing in 2014.</p>

          <p>Bertone has marked the history of the automobile by designing mythical cars, likeLamborghini Miura and Countach, the Alfa Romeo Coupe Bertone.</p>

          <p>Bodybuilder on the one hand, Bertone had also become an automotive subcontractor by hosting in its premises production units for manufacturers, the company had even become a car manufacturer by marketing vehicles under its own brand.</p>
